Research on deriving expressions for converters without the use of the Small-Ripple Approximation.

It is possible to solve converters exactly, without the use of the small-ripple approximation. We consider
a boost converter to demonstrate this. First, we find the Laplace transform to write expressions for the
waveforms of the sub-circuits of the boost converter. We then invert the transforms, match boundary conditions,
and find the periodic steady-state solution of the circuit. Having done so, we then find the DC components
of the waveforms and the peak values.
